##V2: Skeletal 
The following repository contains Leap Motion SDK examples built with Javascript. Each project is built using V2 Core Services Skeletal Tracking code from [Leap Motion's Developer Portal](https://developer.leapmotion.com/). For additional support with these examples and more, feel free to reach out to us via: [Leap Motion's Community Forums](https://community.leapmotion.com/)  

##Getting Started
####1. Clone the GitHub repository and choose a project (i.e. finger-labels):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:leapmotion-examples/javascript
cd javascript/v2/finger-labels
```

####2. Serve code

Open finger-labels/index.html in your favorite web browser. Similarly, you can use a basic [Node.js Web Server](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-http-server) to serve your static file directory:
```bash
sudo npm install http-server -g
cd <clone_directory>/javascript/v2/finger-labels
http-server
```

####3. You're done!
* Move your hands above the Leap Motion Controller and you should be seeing a simple hand with joints.
* If not, see our [FAQ](https://developer.leapmotion.com/downloads/skeletal-beta/faq) section
